                    Our founder, Thomas Hill, had both an eye for quality and a desire to innovate.
                    As well as using the finest fibres such as Sea Island cotton, cashmere and silk,
                    he invented his own fabrics. Sunspel continues this commitment to innovation
                    today and our unique fabrics include: Q100 Sea Island cotton, Q82 Supima cotton,
                    Q75 warp knit mesh cotton and Q14 warp knit cellular cotton. The technology behind
                    these fabrics remains unchanged today and all Sunspel products use the finest cottons,
                    wools and fibres.
